const FIRST_DEATH = `
People who have the potential to become immortal are pre-immortal until they have their First Death.
The process is trigged by the "shock of a violent death" and that without such a trigger the pre-immortal person will
simply age and die as other humans.

After the First Death triggers the immortality, the immortal now has full access to their healing abilities and will stop aging.
They have no access to their powers at all until after the First Death.
